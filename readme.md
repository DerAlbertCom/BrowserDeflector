# Browser Deflector *Work in Progress*

Browser Deflector will be registerd as the Default Browser in the System. So that
every link (http and https) will be open by Deflector, then Deflector decides on
die Domainname (or later be more sophisticated) which browser to start for real.

## Use Cases

### Software Development

If you are like me, then you may have different Browser Profiles defined in Chrome,
for different customeres, different projects or whatever.

But when you get mail for that projects which links to the customers Azure DevOps, Jira,
Teamcity or what else then your default browser will be openend instead of the correct
browser with the right profile which has the correct cookies and plugins installed.

This also works with Links within IDEs which then will opens in the correct browser

### Freelance works with different Customers

Same a Software Development, without IDE ;-)

### WebSite Compatiblity

If you have still use Websites which only runs in IE 11 for reasons, then this might
be a tool for you.
